1. Total Employees

This KPI shows the total number of unique employees present in the payroll system. It represents the overall workforce size of the organization.

2. Active Employees

This KPI counts the employees who are currently active and working in the organization. These employees are expected to receive salary and benefits.

3. Inactive Employees

This KPI shows the number of employees who are marked as inactive. Ideally, inactive employees should not receive salary, so this helps in identifying payroll risks.

4. Total Payroll Cost

This KPI represents the total amount of salary paid to all employees in a given period. It reflects the overall payroll expenditure of the organization.

5. Average Salary

This KPI shows the average salary of employees. It helps management understand salary distribution and compare compensation levels across periods or departments.

6. Salary Leakage Amount

This KPI calculates the total extra amount paid beyond the approved salary. It highlights direct financial loss due to payroll errors or policy violations.

7. Salary Leakage Employees

This KPI counts how many employees received salary credits higher than their approved salary. It helps identify individuals or departments causing payroll leakage.

8. Overtime Abuse Count

This KPI shows the number of employees who exceeded allowed overtime limits. It indicates misuse of overtime policies or workload imbalance.

9. Ghost Employee Count

This KPI identifies inactive employees who are still receiving salary. These are considered ghost employees and represent a serious payroll fraud risk.

10. Missing Attendance Count

This KPI shows the number of employees with missing or incomplete attendance records. Missing attendance directly affects payroll accuracy and compliance.

11. Cost per Employee

This KPI represents the average total cost incurred per employee, including salary and overtime pay. It helps evaluate workforce cost efficiency.

12. Payroll Leakage Percentage

This KPI shows the percentage of payroll lost due to salary leakage. It provides a clear view of payroll inefficiency relative to total payroll cost.

13. Overtime Dependency Rate

This KPI measures the proportion of employees who rely on overtime. A high value indicates excessive overtime usage and potential operational inefficiency.
